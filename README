Spring integration for RabbitMQ


These components help using RabbitMQ in a similar way as with the Spring JMS components.
This initial version contains a simple connection and channel factory (currently only with single connection).

There is a small maven dependency to the functional java library, which can be downloaded from http://functionaljava.org/
and then installed in your local repository.

Example spring configuration is provided in src/main/test/spring-examples.xml
