Spring integration for RabbitMQ


These components help using RabbitMQ with the Spring Framework.
This initial version contains a simple connection and channel factory (currently only with single connection).

There is a small maven dependency to the functional java library, which can be downloaded from http://functionaljava.org/
and then installed in your local repository.

Example spring configuration(s) is provided in src/main/test/spring-examples.xml

--------------------------------------
javadocs are coming, but the examples should be self explaining enough,
especially if your familiar with the JMS components of Spring.
